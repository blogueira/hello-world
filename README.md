short description
okie my name is blogueira, er actually it is not, but i was told to write about me but i do not want to
i have never tried github before
and i hate branches
i ain't no monkey

and

i love chess
and ballet

i hate programming
for some reason i love writing hate and love texts

i guess it has to do with the god damn bad english classes we have in brazil
we never get passed learning the to be verb

it really, really sucks
effing third world countries
